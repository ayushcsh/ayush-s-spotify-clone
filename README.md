So basically, I built a Spotify clone â€” my own version of that vibe-y music player we all love. It's simple but it does the job. You can play songs, pause, skip, and vibe along. The UI is clean, inspired by Spotify's look, but with my own touch. Of course, right now, itâ€™s limited to a few songs because backend stuff is still a work in progress (learning that slowly ðŸ˜…).

The goal was to understand how music apps actually work â€” handling play/pause states, switching tracks, managing song data, and giving that smooth user experience. Every button click, every song change, made me realize how much goes on behind the scenes in real apps.

For now, itâ€™s frontend-focused â€” pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But soon, Iâ€™m planning to connect it to a real backend and maybe even add features like playlists, search, and shuffle.

It's more than just a clone for me â€” itâ€™s my step into the real-world side of development, where things look good and work well.
